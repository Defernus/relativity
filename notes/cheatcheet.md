# Lorentz transformation

## Translate coordinates between two frames of reference

$$

\beta = \frac{v}{c} \\

$$

$$

x' = \gamma(x - vt) \\

x' = \gamma(x - \beta ct) \\

$$

$$

t' = \gamma(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}) \\

ct' = \gamma(ct - \beta x) \\

$$

$$

\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\

\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}

$$

# Time dilation and length contraction

$$

\Delta T' = \frac{\Delta T}{\gamma} \\

\Delta T' = \Delta T \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}

$$

$$

\Delta X' = \frac{\Delta X}{\gamma} \\

\Delta X' = \Delta X \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}

$$

# Simultaneity

If 2 events has same time in one frame of reference, then we can calculate time
difference between these events in another frame of reference using Lorentz
transformation.

$$

\begin{cases}

\Delta T = 0 \\

\Delta T' = \gamma \frac{v \Delta X}{c^2}

\end{cases}

$$

And if 2 events has same position and time in one frame of reference, then they
are simultaneous in every frame of reference.

# Velocity transformation

- $V_B$ is the velocity of object $B$ in frame of reference $F_A$ along the $X$
  axis.
- $V_C$ is the velocity of object $C$ in frame of reference $F_A$ along the $X$
  axis.

To find $V_C'$ - velocity of object $C$ in frame of reference $F_B$:

$$

V_C' = \frac{V_C - V_B}{1 - \frac{V_C V_B}{c^2}}

$$

# Spacelike and timelike separation

If $\Delta x^2 > (c \Delta t)^2$, then events are spacelike separated. In
different frames of reference, the order of these events can be different.

If $\Delta x^2 < (c \Delta t)^2$, then events are timelike separated. The order
of these events is the same in every frame of reference.
